# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction Model

This project is a **Machine Learning model** that predicts whether a person is diabetic or not based on their health data. It uses the **PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset** and a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** classifier for prediction.

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset used is the **PIMA Diabetes Dataset**, which contains health-related attributes such as:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- Blood Pressure
- Skin Thickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- Diabetes Pedigree Function
- Age
- Outcome (0: Non-diabetic, 1: Diabetic)

---

## 🧪 Libraries Used

- `NumPy` for numerical computations  
- `Pandas` for data manipulation  
- `Scikit-learn` for preprocessing, model building, and evaluation  

---

## 🛠️ Features

- Data cleaning and statistical analysis
- Feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Train-test split (80-20)
- SVM classifier (linear kernel)
- Accuracy measurement on training and test data
- Predictive system that takes user input and gives diabetic/non-diabetic result
